            As technology advances, mobile phone gaming continues to improve visually as phones become more powerful, but mobile gaming still doesn't hold a candle to gaming PCs and consoles. That is until the release of the Nintendo Switch.

            <p class="main-text">Released on March 3, the Nintendo Switch looks to make the console experience portable. For gamers in cities like New York where commuting on the subway is part of their day, the Switch is a new tool to deal with the latest scourge of the
                gaming public: the backlog.

                <p class="main-text">Nintendo estimates that they'll sell 13 million Switch units by April 2018. Although that puts them far behind the PS4 and its 60 million consoles sold as well as the 30 million Xbox One consoles, Nintendo looks to reach a different audience
                    with their portable console.

                    <p class="main-text">Due to video game prices dropping at faster and faster rates today's gamer can purchase more games. The more games a gamer has the less likely they will beat the games thus creating a backlog. There are guides and websites dedicated
                        to tackling backlogs.

                        <p class="main-text">With the Switch, however, daily commutes will help gamers tackle their backlogs.

                            <p class="main-text">"My commute is completely random. It can be 25 minutes or 50 minutes," said 28-year-old gamer Mike Bain. "When I saw that the Switch could be taken on the go, I knew I had to get this. If I can play Zelda at home and take it
                                with me, I'm way into that."

                                <p class="main-text">

                                    The amount of time needed to beat a game today ranges. Some simple indie games can be beaten within two hours while long, epic games can take more than 50 hours to beat. On average, most games will take eight hours to beat. Use the calculator below to
                                    take the amount of minutes commmunity each day and how many days you commute. The calculator will reveal how many games that could be beaten in one month.
